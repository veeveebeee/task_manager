# task_manager

● This is a project done as part of my Software Engineering course. It was done at roughly the halfway mark, and there are improvements I now want to go back and make, 
but it will be a work in progress on here.

● It takes 2 .txt files, of usernames and passwords, and user tasks, and creates an interface for the user to log in and interact with them.

● README and code need to be completed, so excuse the lack of information here for now!
